## What are Fractals?
***Fractals*** are *absolutely* fascinating and mersmerizing, aren't they? But what exactly are fractals? <br>
They are a class of geometrical figures which have an extremely interesting property: they are **self-similar**. <br>
This means that however infinitely one zooms into the image, one only views the geometrical figure that was started with! <br>

### Origin of Fractals
The term **Fractal** is derived from the Latin Word *fractus*. It means something that is broken. Fractals were named so in 1975 by  Benoit Mandelbrot. <br>
He described that each portion of a fractal is basically a replication of the original.

***The Sierpinski triangle*** <br>
One of the most popular examples of Fractals is the Sierpinski triangle. <br>
It is created by connecting the mid points of all the three sides of a triangle. These line segments give the smaller triangle, and this goes on. <br>
This creates a visualization of *infinite triangles within a single triangle*. It was described in 1915 by Waclaw Sierpinski. <br>

***The Koch Curve***<br>
The Koch Curve begins with a straight line. It is divided into three line segments of equal lengths. <br>
The line in the middle is replaced by the top part of a triangle. The sides of the triangle are the same length as the line in the center that was replaced. <br> 
A similar and related fractal is the Koch Snowflake. It begins with an equilateral triangle. It is also known as the Koch Star. <br>
At every scale of zooming in, the shape seems to be exactly the same as the one we began with. <br>

***The Mandelbrot Fractal*** <br>
This is one of the most facsinating and intriguing fractals. It was named after Benoit Mandelbrot, a pioneer of fractal geometry. <br>
It is based on a very simple *complex quadratic recurrence* equation: **Z<sub>n+1</sub> = Z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + C** <br>
It gives a set of points on the complex plane.<br>

## What is the Golden Ratio?
The Golden Ratio is sometimes also known as the **divine proportion**. It is denoted by *phi* <br>
An interesting recurrence equation which relates to this is **a<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> = a<sub>n-1</sub> +1** <br>
With *a<sub>1</sub>=1* one deduces that *lim<sub>n->âˆž</sub> a<sub>n</sub> = phi* <br>
Its value approximately equal to 1.618 but it is infact, an *irrational number*. <br>
